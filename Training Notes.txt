ADO.NET
	ADO - Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects
	ODBC, OLEDB (COM, COM+)
	
Disconnected Architecture (DA).
	Web Services ===> SOAP -> Simple Object Access Protocol.
		Fetch the data.
		No need for a live connection to the DB all the time.
		Process or work on it locally, without having a live connection to the DB.
		When required, just send it back to the DB.
		Caching, Web Services (XML), Perform lot of processing on the data.
	Demerits:
		If the no. of rows fetched was too large, then DA would have perfomance issues.
		
	
Connected Architecture (CA).
	Connect to the DB.
	Fetch the data.
	Store it in objects.
	Close connection.
	
Connection String
Connection Object
Command Object
Reader


.NET Core => New
Pre-.net core => .NET Framework

"Server=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=EnumDb;user id=abc;password=abc;"

.NET Core:
add Nuget package:
	install-package System.Data.SqlClient
	OR 
	thru the Nuget Package UI.
	
cmd.ExecuteReader() ===> Reader object.
cmd.ExecuteNonQuery()   ===> Does not return any rows/data. Just returns the no. of rows affected.
cmd.ExecuteScalar() ===> Returns a single value.

SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE ProductCategory = 204
GROUP BY ProductCategory

10
20
14

INSERT INTO Employees (Lastname, Firstname)
VALUES ('Smith', 'John');
SELECT @@IDENTITY;


SQL Injection:
SELECT CustomerId, CompanyName, ContactName, City
FROM Customers
WHERE City = 'London';DELETE FROM Users --

SQL Injection works:
string qry = " SELECT CustomerId, CompanyName, ContactName, City";
qry += $" FROM Customers";
qry += $" WHERE City = '{city}'";

SQL Injection does not work:
string qry=" SELECT CustomerId, CompanyName, ContactName, City";
qry+=$" FROM Customers";
qry+=$" WHERE City = @City";

string.Format("SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = {0} AND State = {1}", state, city);

Disconnected Architecture (DA) of ADO.NET:
Connection object
DataAdapter (DA)
DataSet (DS)

Performance impact if the dataset size was too big.

Easily convert the DS into XML.
But, the size of the XML would be very large.

<Customers>
	<Customer>
		<Id>101</Id>
		<name>john smith</name>
		<city>mumbai</city>
		:
		:
	</Customer>
	<Customer>
		<Id>102</Id>
		<name>mary jane</name>
		<city>indore</city>
		:
		:
	</Customer>

</Customers>


In-memory, load 2 tables in DS, set relationships in-memory.

SELECT 
	c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName, 
	o.OrderId, o.OrderDate, od.PRoductId, p.PRoductName, od. Qty, od.Price
FROM Customers 
INNER JOIN Orders o ON o.customerid = c.customerid
INNER JOIN ORderDetails od ON od.OrderId = o.ORderId
INNER JOIN PRoducts p = p.productid = od.productid

LINQ: Language INtegrated Query.
- It gives SQL query type syntax.
- Method syntax.
	- ToList()
	- First()
	- FirstOrDefault()
	- Single()
	- SingleOrDefault()

- query syntax.

Anonymous Type.

Eager Loading using .Include()
Explicit Loading
Lazy Loading

There are 6-7-8 tables (objects/collections).
	- We do not need data from all the tables.
	- To load data on an as-needed basis, we use explicit loading.
	
Create an Order:
	Order
	CustomerId
	EmployeeId
	Order Details (collection)
		Product
		
Banking App => Transfer from AccA to AccB
	Withdraw in AccA
	Deposit in AccB
	
	Deposit in AccB worked.
	Withdraw in AccA failed (insufficient balance).
	
Transaction Management
	
In EF, Cascade Delete is enabled by default.

Database First approach.

Code First Approach:
	- You start with no DB at all.
	- Start with creating your model (all your entity classes).
	- Run your app, it will create the schema (db, tables, relations).
	- Gradually, you will create more models (entities).
	- Enable Migrations
	- You add 2 more tables.
	- You create a new migration.
	- Update the database for this migration.
	- It will create the new tables
		- OR ALTER tables or whatever new changes you made.
	- Have to very careful especially with PROD dbs.
	
.NET Core:
	- .NET Core vs .NET Framework:
		- .NET Core supports multiple platforms.
		- Create a project on Windows, it will run on Linux.
		- Or vice-versa.
		
EF vs EF Core:

.NET Core:
	- By default, only bare minimum packages are part of the project.
	- You have to add any and all required packages/libraries explicitly.
	- JSON config files are way to go forward.
	- Usually, config files are named "appSettings.json".
	- To read the json config file, we have to use the configuration manager by explicitly adding the package for that.
		- install-package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
	- Because we are reading JSON, we have to include the JSON related package as well.
		- install-package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json
	- For EF Core, include it's package:
		- install-package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
	- For SQL Server, add it's package:
		- install-package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
	- To read the config files and map to custom classes, add the Hosting package:
		- install-package Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting
	- Change the "Copy to output directory" property of the config file (appSettings.json) to "Copy always".
		- This will ensure that the config file is copied to the output folder everytime you do a build.
		- This is because the executable looks for the config file in the same folder where the executable resides.
	- In EF (pre-.net core era):
		- Define a DbContext classes
		- Define a connection string with the same name as the DbContext class in app.config.
		- It will automatically do the mapping and connect to the DB.
	- In EF Core, it is not that straightforward
		- You have to explicitly read the connection string from the config file.
		- And then give it to the DbContext class.
		- In the ctor of the DbContext class,
			- Read the connection string via the Config object
		- Override the OnConfiguring method of the DbContext class
			- specify .UseSqlServer(connectionString):
			protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
			{
				optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(_connectionString);
			}			
		- Then, use DbContext instance and it's entity collection as usual.
		
Database First: where db already exists.
Code First Approach:
	- Where we create the model (entities) first and then based on the model, the DB will be created.
	- To do this, we have to enable "migrations".
	
install-package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
install-package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
install-package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

Add-Migration CreateDb
Update-Database

Change model.
Add-Migration "Changes Done"
Update-Database


DB Migrations in EF Core:
	- Building your model first and then asking the framework to create/update the DB based on the changes done to the model.
	
Seed data:
	- Carefully create the data.
	- You have to specify the PK values even if they are auto-generated by the DB.
	- If there are lot of tables and you need lot of data for actual testing, then Seeding can be tedious.
		- Your code can become bloated.
	- If data is to be externally generated or transformed, then seed is not a good idea.
		- Password hashing.
		- API calling.
		- Users are to be created externally
			- Identity
			
Alternative to Seeding is write custom initialization logic.

EF 6 (Pre-Core):
	install-package EntityFramework
	
	Enable-Migrations
	
	Add-Migration <name>
	Update-Database
	
	Seed data:
		- When you enable migration, it creates a Configuration.cs in the Migrations folder.
		- In this class, override the "Seed" method and write your seed code there.


Web APIs:
	- a.k.a Web Services (WS).
	- Web applications without a UI.
	- Over HTTP.
		- www.server.com/apiname/operation
	- CRUD operations can be performed.
		- APIs have web methods
		- These methods are HTTP verbs representing the CRUD operations.
			- GET		Read
			- POST		Create
			- PUT		Update
			- DELETE	Delete
			
Initially, web services were based on SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol.
	- XML
	- as POST
	- Implementation was framework-specific.
		- If a WS is created using .NET, it could be consumed only by a .NET client.
		- XML created would have a lot of additional metadata that could be parsed easily by the framework / library that created the WS.
	- XML data being passed between client-server would become too heavy.
		- impact on performance.
		
<Customers>
	<Customer Id="101">
		<Firstname>John</Firstname>
		<Lastname>Smith</Lastname>
		:
	</Customer>
	<Customer Id="102">
		<Firstname>Mary</Firstname>
		<Lastname>Jane</Lastname>
		:
	</Customer>
</Customers>

	- over a period of time, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) became popular.
	- Why?
		- pure text-based.
		- light-wieght than XML.
		- only had key-value pairs.
		- size was very very small compared to XML.
		
{
	"Customers": [
		{ "id": 101, "firstname": "John", "lastname": "Smith" },
		{ "id": 102, "firstname": "Mary", "lastname": "Jane" },
	]
}
	
	- SOAP also started supporting JSON. Option for XML was still there.
	- SOAP also started supporting GET. POST was still default.
	- SOAP urls and invocation was not "user-friendly".
	
	www.myservice.com/customerservice.asmx?id=101&fname=john&lname=smith
	- Pass data either in the Query String or in the Body.
	
API = Application Programming Interface.

RESTful APIs (Web API):
	- REST: REpresentational State Transfer
	- somewhere around 2000
	- REST API Concepts:
		- server: that offers the API as a means to access the system's data / features.
		- client: that runs on a user's computer/device and initiates the communication.
		- resource: a piece of content that the server can provide to the client
			- a video.
			- a text.
			- customer data.
			- order data.
	- Supports all HTTP verbs / methods:
		- GET
		- PUT
		- POST
		- DELETE
	- An endpoint: a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) indicates where and how to find a resource.
		- www.someserver.com/customer/1
	- Headers:
		- Since APIs work over HTTP, HTTP works on a request-response basis.
		- Every request/response has a Header.
		- store information about the request/response that is relevant to both, the client and the server.
			- an API key.
			- the format of the data being sent/received.
			- Authorization.
	- Body:
		- used to convey / send / receive additional data about the resource.
		- Usually used for PUT and POST requests.
		
	www.myservice.com/customerservice.asmx?id=101&fname=john&lname=smith&mname=abc&city=indore....
	www.someserver.com/customer?id=101&fname=john&lname=smith&mname=abc&city=indore....
	Instead, you pass the data in the body of the request-response
	
	So, the url will still be:
		www.someserver.com/customerrecord
		But the data is passed in the body usually as a JSON:
		{
			"id": 101, 
			"firstname": "John", 
			"lastname": "Smith",
			:
		}

	All requests when they return a response also return the status of the operation performed.
	- HTTP Status Codes
		- 2xx status codes
		- 3xx status codes
		- 4xx status codes
		- 5xx status codes
		Examples:
			- 200 OK.
		https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html

WSDL: Web Service Description Language: Discovery of Web Services.
- Postman
- Fiddler
- Swagger
	- It also gives the description of your API:
		- what is the url
		- what params required
		- HTTP Verb
		- Header requirements
		- what body is required
		- what is returned (header/body).

WSDL in XML format.
	- extract this WSDL (in xml) and share it with your client (consumers)
	- Global Discovery / Private discovery.
	
RESTful APIs:
	- Caching
	- Stateless interactions (default)
		- an API does not remember or store any information about the previous sessions.
		- Treats each request independently.
		- All data on the current request / state is included in the request body.

		- Stateful service:
			- when the server (api) remembers / stores information about previous session(s).
			- E.g.;
				- a client authenticates
				- then makes a request (to get some data)
				- expected behavior is that the API remembers that the client is already authenticated in a previous request and hence proceeds with the "get" request and returns the relevant data.
		- Authentication (first time), userid/pwd is never sent in the Query String.
			- It is a GET operation.
			- But auth is always done as a POST.
			- Always pass creds in the body of the request.
			- The API will return a TOKEN once authenticated.
			- This token is to be sent with every future request to the API.
				- The API validates the token and then processes the request.
				- if valid, returns the data / performs the ops.
				- if invalid, 401.
			- This "token" has an expiry.
				- Usually the apps have an expriy 60-90 days for the token.
				- Client has to re-authenticate after token expires.
				- Every time you use the token (the expiry is extended for the expiry period).
				
		- All APIs today use token-based authentication via Identity Providers (IPs).
			- Active Directory.
			- Azure AD.
			- AWS IAM.
			- Google Users
			- Okta
		- SAML
		- OAuth2
		
			
.NET Core / ASP.NET Core:
	- Almost everything is based on Dependency-Injection (DI).
		- DI:
			- components / services are "injected" into your code.
			- due to this, you don't have to explicitly instantiate your service.
			- it will get instantiated automatically.
			
Web Server:
	- On Windows, Web apps run on IIS.		
	- IIS: Internet Information Server.
		- Host for running web apps on Windows.
	- all .NET-based web apps run on IIS.
	- Earlier, for .NET web apps, it was mandatory to have IIS installed on dev machines.
	- As Windows O/S progressed, IIS installation was restricted to Admins only.
	- Usually, enterprises do not give local admin rights to everyone, including devs.
	- Microsoft later provided a IIS-Express, a scaled down version of IIS as part of Visual Studio.
	- But, IIS is ONLY for windows-based apps.
	- So, what about .NET Core?
	- Replaced IIS-Express with Kestrel.
	- Kestrel is web host (server) that is used to run VS-based web apps.
	
			
	api/values				GET		==> To fetch ALL records. GetAll()
	api/values/1			GET		==> to fetch a particular record. GetById().
	api/values				POST	==> create a record. Data is required.
	api/values/2			PUT
	api/values/3			DELETE
	
	api/customer/search		POST
		Body:
			{
				"city": "mumbai",
				"age": 25
			}
		
Unit Testing:
	In Unit Testing, we do not actually deal with "real data".
		- use dummy data.
		- do not use the DEV db.
		- Definitely do not use the TEST, STAGE, PROD Db.
		- "Mock" your data - temp/dummy data.

For DI (Repository Pattern): (Psuedo-code):
	1. Create an interface.
	2. Implement the interface.
	3. Implement it's ctor to get an instance of the DbContext (via DI).
	4. Make calls to DbContext from implemented methods.
	5. In the controller:
		i. Remove all references to the DbContext.
		ii. Change the ctor to get an instance of the Repo implemented.
		iii. Change all methods to use the repo instead of the DbContext instance.
	6. Inject the repo in Program.cs

Generic Repository.
Build APIs for all HTTP Verbs (GET POST PUT DELETE).	
CORS => Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
Create API in .NET Framework 4.8 with DI.

Data Annotations:
[Table]
[Key]
[Column("fname")]
[MaxLength(100)]
[StringLength(10)]
[StringLength(10, Error="Username cannot be more than 10 characters.")]
[StringLength(10, MinimumLength=5, Error="{0} length must be between {2} and {1} characters.")]
public string Username {get;set;}

Entered value: abc
Username must be between 5 and 10 characters.

[Required]
[Range(18, 60)]
public int Age {get;set;}

public string Password {get;set;}

[Compare(nameof(Password), ErrorMessage="Passwords do not match")]
public string ConfirmPassword {get;set;}

public class MyCustomAttribute : ValidationAttribute
{
	protected override ValidationResult IsValid(object val, ValidationContext context)

		return ValidationResult.Success;
	}
}

ASP.NET (.NET Framework 4.8):
	- two types web application with UI.
		1. Web Forms.
		2. MVC apps.
	- Console apps:
		app.config
	- Web apps (incl. mvc):
		Web.config
	- Starting point is Global.asax and not Program.cs.
		- Method is Application_Start().
	- API controllers inherit from ApiController
		- Web forms inherit from Controller.
	- The default controller is HomeController.
	- The default action is Index().
	- You do not need to specify the [HttpGet] [HttpPost] etc. attributes explicitly.
		- as long as your methods are named properly.
	- You can specify [HttpGet] [HttpPost] etc.attribute if you want.
		- You must do that if there are multiple GET, POST etc. methods.
	
Using Generics to create "common" or "generic" interfaces.
	List<int>
	List<string>
	List<Customer>
	List<Product>
	
In .NET Framework 4.8, for DI, we have to install a package:
	Unity.Mvc5		==> Web forms.
	Unity.WebApi	==> Web APIs.

	install-package Unity.WebApi
	Add DI code to UnitConfig.RegisterComponents() method:
		container.RegisterType<IDataRepository<Customer>, CustomerRepository>();

	In Global.asax.cs file's Application_Start() method:
		UnityConfig.RegisterComponents();


Consuming an API:
	- .NET
	- Angular / React 
	- JavaScript
	
install-package Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client

Asynchronous programming in .NET:
	- async-await

sync = synchronous
async = asynchronous

public void foo()
{
	// code
	doSomething();
	// code.
}

async method always returns either void or a "Task" or "Task<T>" type.

CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
Enable CORS on our API to allow client applications (running on different "origins") to consume the API.
One client: Full access to the API.
2nd client: Access to only GET methods.


Minimal APIs:
	- No controllers.
	- Are to be created only for simple or small APIs.
	
Asynchronous Programming in C#:
	async await
	Synchronous process is where you have to wait for a long running process to complete before you can proceed with any other operation.
	
	LP Started
	(wait 4 seconds)
	LP completed
	SP started
	SP completed
	
	Async Programming is the code gets executed on a thread without waiting for a long running task to be completed.
	
	To make a process asynchronous:
		- you have to mark that method as async.
		- async methods return either a void, Task, Task<T>.
		- when calling that method, call it with await.
		
	LP started (wait 4 seconds in the background)
	SP started
	SP completed
	LP completed (after 4 seconds)
	
Making Breakfast:
	Make coffee							async
	Pour juice glass					sync
	Toast 2 slices bread				async
	Apply butter in the bread slices	sync
	Fry 2 eggs							async
	
	Approach #1:
		Task<Egg> te = FryEggs();
		Task<Coffee> tc = MakeCoffee();
		Task<Toast> tt = ToastBread();
		
		var toast = await tt;
		ApplyButter(toast);
		
		var eggs = await te;
		
		var coffee = await tc;
		PourCoffee();
		PourJuice();
		
		HaveBreakfast();

	Approach #2:
		Task<Egg> te = FryEggs();
		Task<Coffee> tc = MakeCoffee();
		Task<Toast> tt = ToastBread();
		
		await Task.WhenAll(te, tc, tt);
		ApplyButter();
		PourCoffee();
		PourJuice();
		HaveBreakfast();

	Approach #3:
		Task<Egg> te = FryEggs();
		Task<Coffee> tc = MakeCoffee();
		Task<Toast> tt = ToastBread();
		
		var breakfastTasks = new List<Task> { te, tc, tt };
		while(breakfastTasks.Count > 0)
		{
			Task finishedTask = await Task.WhenAny(breakfastTasks);
			if(finishedTask == te)
			{
				Console.WriteLine("Eggs are ready.");
			} else if(finishedTask == tc)
			{
				Console.WriteLine("Coffee is ready.");
				PourCoffee();
			} else if(finishedTask == tt)
			{
				Console.WriteLine("Bread Toast is ready.");
				ApplyButter();
			}
			breakfastTasks.Remove(finishedTask);
		}
		
	
async Scheduler()
{
	while(true)
	{
		get schedule from DB.
		if it is time, run the process.
		wait for it to finish.
		mark the scheduled time process as done.
	}
}

Callbacks:
	delegates
	Name of the delegate becomes it's type.
	
	Events + Delegates
	click of a button
	
Assignment:
	The banking app, convert it into APIs.
	Use DB (EF Core).
	Have as many CRUD operations.
	Separate layers (projects) as needed.
	Use Repository Pattern.

	Nice to haves:
		- Unit Tests using xUnit.
		- Logging to a file
			- NLog
			- Serilog
			
Unit Testing:
	- Using xUnit.
	Types of testing:
		- System testing: Testing / QA team - end to end testing.
			- Test cases
		- Load testing / Performance testing.
			- Script or automated tool.
		- Smoke testing.
		- Security Penetration Testing.
			- SecPen Testing
		- Unit Testing:
			- Is to be done by DEVs.
			- Code has to be written.
			- Takes ~25-40% of the effort taken to develop the actual feature to be tested.
			- Test each and every method that has been implemented.
			- Test not just the valid "params" or the Happy Path.
			- Must test for invalid values / scenarios as well.
			- Including any exceptions that may occur.
			- Unit Test should always be done using dummy data.
				- Should not directly change the database in use (by DEVs, QA, UAT, Staging, PROD).
				- Can use "mocking" of data.
			- TDD: Test Driven Development.
				- You write the unit tests first and then the actual feature code.
				- Initially, all your unit tests should fail.
				- As you complete your feature implementation, the unit tests will keep passing.
			- DEVs create their own unit test cases.
				- DEVs could take the test cases from the QA team.
			- AAA:
				Arrange, Act & Assert.
				
Arrange:
	Get your code ready to be tested.
	Creating instance of classes.
	Initialize values etc.
Act:
	Call the method to be tested.
	Perform the action and get the result back.
Assert:
	Validate the result.
	
			- Code coverage:
				- How many lines of code are covered by the unit tests?
				
public bool DoSomething(string val)
{
    bool isValid = true;
	
	// code here.
	// code here.

https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/bitwise-operators
Be careful when using Enum Flags (because of Bitwise operators):
	- Having negative numbers in contants.
	- Good pratice to have a None = 0.
	- None (0) cannot be used with Bitwise AND (&).
		- It will always give 0.

	j = 1;
}
What will be the value of j here if i is NULL and if i is NOT NULL?

Access modifiers:
=================
private
public
protected
internal

private: member accessible only within the class where it has been declared.
public: member accessible to all other classes from anywhere.
protected: member is accessible within the class where it has been declared and by derived classes.

public class ClassA
{
	protected void X()
	{
	}
	
	private void Y()
	{
		X();
	}
}

public class ClassX
{
	public void foo()
	{
		var objA = new ClassA();
		objA.X();	// Not accessible.
	}
}

public class ClassB : ClassA
{
	public void foobar()
	{
		this.X();	// accessible.
	}
}

internal: keyword. members are visible only wihtin the files in the same assembly.

API			- Assembly (.dll)
	ClassA (of Services) is not accessible here).
Services	- Assembly (.dll)
	ClassA.cs:
		internal class ClassA { }
		
	ClassB.cs:
		ClassA is accessible in ClassB.
		
Repository	- Assembly (.dll)
	ClassA (of Services) is not accessible here).
Entities	- Assembly (.dll)
	ClassA (of Services) is not accessible here).

Partial classes:
================
- used to split definition of classes / interface into multiple code files.

A.cs
public partial class Employee
{
	public void DoWork() { }
}

B.cs
public partial class Employee
{
	public void GoToLunch() {}
}

Code is generated by the the framework or the IDE.
.edmx
.edmx.cs

// file1.cs
partial void DoWork();

// file2.cs
partial void DoWork()
{
	// code here.
}

Extension Methods: used when you do not have access to the code.
	string name = "My name is john Smith";
	
	want this: "My Name Is John Smith";
	CapitalizeWords()
	
public static class MyStringExtensions
{
	public static string CapitalizeWords(this string someString)
	{
		// code here.
		return result;
	}
}

string name = "My name is john Smith";
Console.WriteLine(name.CapitalizeWords());

Local Methods / Functions:
==========================
Introduced in C#7.0.
Declare a method inside the body of another method.
Scope of the local method is limited to the method in which it has been created.

void foo(string msg)	// container function/method.
{
	int x = 10;	// variable declared in the container ().
	
	void foobar()
	{
		int y = 0;	// accessible only within the local ().
		x = 20;		// container vars are accessible in local ().
		Console.WriteLine(msg);	// can access container method's params.
	}

	void foobar(int a) {}		// cannot overload local methods.
	
	string abc(string a, string b)
	{
		return "abc";
	}
	
	// code.
	foobar();
	// code.
	var result = abc("john", "smith");
}

do()
{
	foo().foobar();	// not allowed.
	foobar();		// not allowed.
}

Summary of local methods:
	- multiple local methods allowed.
	- can access variables defined in the container ().
	- cannot be static.
	- cannot overload.
	- can have return types and params.
	- can be async.
	- cannot specify access modifiers.
	
yield:
======
yield statement - provides the next element.


Record:
=======
Introduced C# 9.0.

public record Person(string firstname, string lastname, string city);

very similar to creating a class:
public class Person
{
	public string firstname {get;set;}
	public string lastname {get;set;}
	public string city {get;set;}
	
}

To use a record, just create an instance:
Person p1 = new Person("John", "Smith", "Boston");


x = 1
y = 1

Attribute:
==========
[ApiController]
[Route]
[HttpGet]
[HttpPost]
[EnableCors]
[Required]
[StringLength]
[EmailAddress]


Can be provided on classes, methods, properties.

When we use attributes to define the behavior of class/method/property, it is a "declarative" way of coding.

[Obsolete("SomeClass will become obsolete. Use NewClass instead.")]
public class SomeClass
{
}

public class NewClass
{
}

Arguments to the ctor are limited to simple types/literals: bool, int, string, enum, array of these types.
Cannot use expressions.
Cannot use variables.

Custom Attributes: 
	- Derive from Attribute.
	- Attribute usage (where can it be applied: class, method, property].

Action Filters:
===============
Attributes applied on Controller Actions (methods).

Types of Filters in ASP.NET:
	- Authorization Filter.
	- Resource Filters: OnResourceExecuting, OnResourceExecuted.
	- Action Filters: On...Executing, On...Executed.
	- Exception Filters.
	- Result Filter: used to modify the result.

Event:
======
A late binding mechanism. Work with Delegates.
Events are a way for an object to broadcast to it's subscribers that something happened.
Subscribing to an event creates a coupling between the Publisher and the Subscriber (Pub-Sub model).
Based on the "Observer Design Pattern".

The class that raises the event is known as the Publisher.
The class that receives the notification is the Subscriber.
There can be >1 subscribers to an event.
